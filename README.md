# Project Android Project: Walk in Clinics Services App
The application addresses the need for people to know waiting times at nearby walk-in clinics without having to leave their home. It also allows users to know the services offered by nearby walk-in clinics and allow them to check-in/book appointments at the clinic of their choice

## Instructions
The purpose of this project is to expand on the theoretical work, allowing students to gain practical experience implementing the concepts learned in class. This project is also designed to allow students to learn how to work with their colleagues and develop mobile applications. Learning outcomes range from increased understanding of concepts relating to software engineering, to overall knowledge of programming for android, management and team-relation skills.

The main outcome of the project is the implementation of a walk in clinics services application for android devices. Students are to implement all components of the project, from their design, specification, UML and additional documentation, graphical assets and source code. Students are encouraged to use the available toolset in android studio but should refrain from copying whole blocks of code from the internet to implement features. Should a group want to use a non-standard tool/API they should request permission before doing so.

The app will be conceived with three different types of users in mind. The administrator, the walk-in clinics employees, and the patients. The administrator manages all the possible services that can be offered to patients by walk-in clinics. The walk-in clinic employee creates a profile for the clinic and selects the services offered by the walk-in clinic and the working hours. The patients can search for a walk-in clinic by address/type of service provided or by working hours.

The features that should be available to each type of user are given below. Note that those are the minimum required features, and you are free to add more features you think might enrich your application.

# The administrator can:  
Create services (at least 5) to be offered by walk-in clinics using the application.  
Delete accounts of walk in clinics and users  
# The walk in clinic employee can:  
Create an account for the walk in clinic  
Select services provided and the rate for each service  
Enter the working hours of the walk in clinic  
# The patient can:  
Create an account  
Search for a walk in clinic by address/type of service provided/working hours  
Check in/book an appointment  
Rate his/her experience at the walk in clinic  
Your application should:  
Show the expected waiting times for walk in clinics based on the number of patients waiting to be seen (assume a fixed time of 15 minutes per patient)  
Show the rating that each walk in clinic has  
Show the admin account all registered users to allow him/her to delete user accounts
